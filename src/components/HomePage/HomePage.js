            <p>Quizzes are good for revision
                Pre-test quizzes can help pupils revise without even realising they are doing it. And a quiz is a good way for a pupil to identify and take ownership of their knowledge gaps. It's also a great way to help them to plug the gaps to boost their confidence when it comes to formal testing.</p>
