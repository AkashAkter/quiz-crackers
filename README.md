# Getting Started with Create React App

## This is what I have done in this project
1. Created some path for home, topics, blogs and statistics.
2. In some paths I've set some API which will show the details. In home I've just shown topic list and in that I've added a button which will take me to the quiz on that topic.
3. In quiz section there is and eye icon which will help user to know the correct answer through alert box.
4. In every click on option it will show is it correct or wrong through alert box.
5. Then there is in topic route where i've just showed topic list. user can't start the quiz on that route by the way.
6. In statistics section there a chart of number of quiz in each topic.
7. And in blog section therer are some question and answer.
